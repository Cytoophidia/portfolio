When considering which city to live in, people always have their own personal preferences on not only the weather but also the annual income, rent, tax, etc. Creating a mobile app that visualizes the weather data and overall economic status has thus become our inspiration. </p>

        <b>Team members: Peggy Wang, Fan Xia</b><br><br>
        <b>Concept Overview:</b>
        <p>Dream City to Live is an AR empowered mobile app that visualizes the subject-matter local data and allows for comparison between different states or cities to help users make a wise moving choice. </p><br>
        <b>Need Analysis:</b>
        <p>Finding a perfect place to live has always been a hard choice that depends hugely on personal preferences, especially when more and more people now have the option to permanently work from home. For those who wanted to explore a new lifestyle in a new city, the research process requires a lot of time investment. People often spend months searching for information and making comparisons to eventually make the final decision. We dedicate ourselves to saving the research time that people spend on getting to know the basics about a state or a city so that users can focus more on personal thinking processes.</p><br>
        <b>Concept Description:</b>
        <p>The global pandemic has changed the way people live, especially with the gradual shift in the working paradigm from daily commuting to working from home. When considering which city to live in, people always have their own personal preferences on not only the weather but also the annual income, rent, tax, etc. Creating a mobile app that visualizes the weather data and overall economic status has thus become our inspiration. <br> In the app, users can either choose to view visualized local data by clicking the name of the state or city on the built-in nation map, or to use the AR feature to scan an actual map in reality to interact with the visualized data. The data we try to include is as follows: local weather summary, annual average income, average monthly rent, annual tax review, user feedback, and so on.</p><br>
        <b>Target Audience:</b>
        <p>The target audience of Dream City to Live is young people aged between 18 to 35 that are trying to find a new city to live in in the United States since people of older age have a higher possibility of settling down in one city with their families and are less likely to move out. Plus, this app is designed for people who are not familiar with American geology and is hoping to learn more about the basics of different states and cities.</p><br>
        <b>Learning Goals:</b>
        <li>Learners will be able to understand the major weather distribution, annual average income, average monthly rent, and tax review of the state or city they are interested in moving to.</li>
        <li>Learners will be able to summarize the weather distinctions between different states or cities through visualized data comparisons.</li>
        <li>Learners will be able to make a decision on which cities they want to live in after using the app.</li><br>
        <b>Learning Theories:</b>
        <li>Dual-coding Theory: This app uses different types of stimuli, including but not limited to animation, image, and text, to help learners encode information in their brains more effectively.</li>
        <li>Social Constructivism: Learners can share reviews on the city they currently live in and search for other usersâ€™ recommendations to build a deeper understanding of the geology and demographics in the U.S. Social interactions and the co-constructed information system can help learners establish their own mind map.</li>
