                <p>I am an adventurer, exploring the infinite possibilities of education. I came to my current faction, which is also our home base, the DMDL master's program at New York University, with like-minded partners from all over the world.</p>

    <h2>How did the narrative participate in my adventure?</h2>
    <div class="board">    
        <p>I believe that narrative is a crucial part of any design. Designers need to put themselves in the shoes of the user to think about the logic of the story and the way it is told. How can you get kids hooked on your story and how can you make it integrate better with different educational tools, such as games and VR, are all questions we can think about.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have taught hands-on STEM-related classes within 18 primary and junior high schools in Shanghai, China. I had not studied learning theory systematically at the time, but my classes were generally considered interesting and capable of learning. After I studied learning theory I found that my class actually incorporated a lot of learning theory, which is probably why it was so popular. So I improved on this and identified the shortcomings, which I believe will guide my course design to be more appropriate.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And that's when the narrative caught my attention. Narrative offers another possibility for engaging children outside of curriculum design. An interesting narrative may be able to make otherwise dry content more accessible. This gave me a new way to think about my curriculum design. I hope to be able to better integrate narratives and games into my possible designs.</p>
