                <p>adding an additional layer of visual interest in your narrative in the form of motion graphics can help tell your story and keep a viewer engaged. <br> <br> A simulated teaching case is used in this page. Suppose in a teaching scenario, the teacher wants to assign an open topic to the students and wants them to investigate the cultural characteristics of a country region, here China is used as an example.</p>

        <b>Scenario</b>
        <p>This is a lesson that took place in a middle school geography class. Students will need to learn about the geography of different country regions and explore their diverse cultures, climates, geographic locations, and other differences. Students were asked to work in a small group for independent projects. This video will show students what their assignment is and how to construct their report, using China as an example.</p> <br>
        <b>Target Learners</b>
        <li>Middle school students</li>
        <li>Can be a student from any area</li>
        <li>Interested in geography</li><br>
        <b>Learning Goals</b>
        <li>Understand the cultural characteristics of China, including food culture, climatic conditions, geographical location, etc.</li>
        <li>Be able to explore independently the geographical features of a new region based on the examples of China told in class and extended to their own independent projects</li><br>
        <b>Leanring Theories</b>
        <li>Constructionism - Build the new knowledge based on learners' prior knowledge</li>
        <li>Advanced Organizer - Give learners an organizational structure at the beginning</li>
        <li>Scaffolding - Be able to give an example to guide the learner for further study</li>
        <li>Transfer Theories - learners will understand the example of China and transfer the structure of this exploration to their own independent projects</li>
