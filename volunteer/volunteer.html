        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> <br><br> This is a portfolio of work from the Narrative, Digital Media, and Learning class. We explore the role of narrative in digital media design for learning. Narrative forms have been used for teaching and learning given their role in memory, cognition, and learner engagement, as well as in case studies of learning, teaching, and research. This course will serve as a laboratory in which we question, investigate, and experiment with narrative and digital media forms, while grounding our inquiry and design work in research and application of learning theory and science.
           <br><br>This page will be a compilation of the content of the assignments and projects in this class</p>
