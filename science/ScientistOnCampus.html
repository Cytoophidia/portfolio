        <div class="board">
            <p>I am a science-related background student who want to teach scientific thinking and more general science knowledge into the curriculum of primary and junior high schools. I participated in the 'Scientists on Campus' event, where I have given classes in 17 primary and junior high schools totally. Designed lessons including aerospace, environment-friendly dams,  prosthetics design, drug development, history of medicine, spirometry, and how to do research. I have also gained a lot from the actual teaching process and continuing improve my curriculum. I hope that with continuous practice and what I learned from DMDL program in NYU, I can make my classroom more enriching and interesting.</p>
