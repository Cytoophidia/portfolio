        <p>I graduated from ShanghaiTech University, majoring in Life Science. During my undergraduate studies, I studied in Hu lab’s and Liu lab’s experimental group, focusing on neurological-related and metabolic-related research. With my science-related background, I was involved in organizing the ‘Scientists on Campus’ event, which was hosted by the Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, responsible for the curriculum design of a series of hands-on STEM courses. <br> <br> I also experimented with developing apps to help kids step out of their comfort zone and explore topics in various fields of knowledge in ‘Introduction to Coding for Learning’ classes during my time at NYU.</p>
