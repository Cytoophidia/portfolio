    <main>
        <p>I had a two-year internship at GLOCAL Education, the Shanghai Advanced Research Institute partner company. I have designed and given STEM classes within <b>18 primary and junior high schools</b> in Shanghai. In total, I developed <b>16 curricula</b> and gave <b>45 lessons</b>. I also led a team in charge of a semester-long drone series course at Eastern Primary School.
           <br><br> I am currently enrolled in the DMDL Master's program at New York University and hope to gain a deeper understanding of education. Combined with my science background, I am committed to helping children learn science lessons better and have a different perception and view of the world through a scientific lens.
